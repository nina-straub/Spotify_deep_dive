The Spotify Deep Dive was a group project in the context of the Digital Shaper programm by TechLabs (https://techlabs.org/de/)
Using our own streaming histories, which can be requested from Spotify, and the spotipy-package we analysed our own listening behaviors
Final goal was to built an ANN and/or Random Forest which can categorize songs into four moods (happy, sad, energetic, calm)
This was realized by collecting trainingsdata from Spotify and using the musical futures Spotify provides to train the ANN
Endproduct was a "Most happy songs" playlist of our own streaming histories which has been created by the ANN
The code, data and outputs in this repository are just snippets from the actual project and shall represent by contribution to the project
No personal data (e. g. streaming histories) from any of the team members is uploaded on this repository
